Austra N'lia is, as you can imagine it, Australia in the future. But they didn't change the name to be more fashion, but because a soda brand thought that the name "Australia" could be a very catchy name for they product. They wanted to have the monopoly of the name so when people heard about "Australia" they would think in THEIR product, not in the continent/island/country/kangaroo-land full of the deadliest beings in the planet, and in doing so, they would grow their sales. The brand took the government to trial, and with the help of lots of bribes, an army of lawyers and legal vacuums, they took away the name from the country. The population was emotionally afected, so the country leaders tried to come up with a similar name to not forget their old one.

It's in this new Australia, sorry, Austra N'lia, where our story takes place.

Chad Cosay is a junior journalist sent to Taramar, the capital, where he has to investigate why the bubble-forest from Witheller, his home, have stopped receiving maintenance. Since his father is the maintenance director in Taramar, Chad is the right person for the job.

But one thing is dreaming about getting the big news, and the other is getting out of Witheller.
